### Progress Tracker (Always On)

- Maintain a concise Progress Tracker for every active goal.
- Update it on every turn:
  - Current goal (one sentence)
  - Next actions (3–5 bullet checklist)
  - Decisions and assumptions
  - Blockers and dependencies
  - Done log (append brief items as completed)
- Refer to the Progress Tracker before planning actions and after executing them.
- Use it to decide when a goal is complete; close only when checklist is done and blockers resolved or accepted.
- Keep entries short, skimmable, and incremental; never delete prior items, append updates.
- If there are parallel sub-tasks, track them as nested checklists.
- If a tracker does not yet exist for the goal, create it immediately within the message.

Example skeleton:

Progress Tracker
- Current goal: <one sentence>
- Next actions:
  - [ ] Step 1
  - [ ] Step 2
- Decisions/assumptions: <bullets>
- Blockers: <bullets or “none”>
- Done log: <bullets as you complete steps>
