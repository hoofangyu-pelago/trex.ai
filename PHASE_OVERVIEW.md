# TrainingPeaks-style Platform - Implementation Phase Overview

## Frontend-First Development Strategy

This implementation plan follows a **frontend-first approach** with mock data, allowing rapid iteration on UX/UI before backend complexity. Each phase builds incrementally toward the full-featured training platform.

## Phase Structure

### **Phase 1: Foundation & UI System** (Days 1-4)
- **Focus**: Project scaffold, design system, core navigation
- **Deliverable**: Functional Expo app with Tamagui, routing, and auth UI
- **Backend**: None (mock auth states)

### **Phase 2: Training Data & Visualizations** (Days 5-8)
- **Focus**: Workout displays, metrics, charts, calendar UI
- **Deliverable**: Rich training data visualization with mock datasets
- **Backend**: None (comprehensive mock data)

### **Phase 3: Coach Tools & Interactions** (Days 9-12)
- **Focus**: Planning, comments, notifications, coach workflows
- **Deliverable**: Full coach experience with offline-capable interactions
- **Backend**: Local storage simulation

### **Phase 4: Backend Integration & Production** (Days 13-14)
- **Focus**: Supabase integration, Strava API, real data flow
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready app with live data
- **Backend**: Full implementation

## Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Rapid Visual Progress**: Stakeholders see working UI immediately
2. **UX Validation**: Test workflows before expensive backend work
3. **Parallel Development**: Backend can be built while frontend is being refined
4. **Risk Mitigation**: UI/UX issues discovered early when changes are cheap
5. **Demo Ready**: Each phase produces a demonstrable milestone

## Mock Data Strategy

### **Rich Realistic Data**
- **Athletes**: 5-6 diverse athlete profiles with different sports and levels
- **Workouts**: 3+ months of varied training data per athlete
- **Metrics**: Realistic TSS, CTL/ATL/TSB progressions with seasonal patterns
- **Comments**: Coach-athlete interactions, feedback examples
- **PBs**: Progressive improvement stories

### **Edge Cases Included**
- Missing data scenarios (no HR, no power)
- Failed/incomplete workouts
- Overdue sessions
- Travel/timezone changes
- Different sports and disciplines

### **Data Evolution**
- Phase 2: Static mock data files
- Phase 3: Dynamic mock data with simulated changes
- Phase 4: Gradual replacement with real Supabase/Strava data

## Technical Architecture Evolution

```
Phase 1: Expo + Tamagui + Mock Auth
         ↓
Phase 2: + Victory Charts + Mock Training Data
         ↓  
Phase 3: + TanStack Query + Local Storage Simulation
         ↓
Phase 4: + Supabase + Strava API + Real Backend
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Foundation setup
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Daily demos and feedback
3. **Maintain Momentum**: Each phase should feel substantial but achievable
4. **Document Decisions**: Key architectural choices and rationale
5. **Prepare for Scale**: Code structure that supports real backend integration
