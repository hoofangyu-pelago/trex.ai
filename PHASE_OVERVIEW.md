# TrainingPeaks-Style Platform - Development Phases Overview

## Phase Breakdown Strategy

This PRD has been broken down into 4 logical development phases that build upon each other. Each phase delivers working functionality while setting up the foundation for subsequent phases.

## Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Foundation) 
    ↓
Phase 2 (Training Data) 
    ↓  
Phase 3 (Coach Tools)
    ↓
Phase 4 (Advanced Features)
```

## Phase Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Days 1-4)
**Goal**: Establish the basic platform with authentication, database, and Strava integration.
**Deliverable**: Users can sign in, connect Strava, and see basic workout data.

### Phase 2: Training Data & Analytics (Days 5-8) 
**Goal**: Build the metrics engine and training analytics that power the platform.
**Deliverable**: Full workout analysis with TSS/IF, CTL/ATL/TSB trends, and PB tracking.

### Phase 3: Coach Tools & Collaboration (Days 9-11)
**Goal**: Enable coaching workflow with planning, feedback, and communication tools.
**Deliverable**: Complete coach-athlete interaction with planning, comments, and notifications.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish (Days 12-14)
**Goal**: Add AI features, admin tools, and production readiness.
**Deliverable**: Full-featured platform ready for production deployment.

## Benefits of This Breakdown

1. **Early Value**: Each phase delivers working functionality
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Core features built first, advanced features last
3. **Dependency Management**: Natural flow from infrastructure to features
4. **Testing Opportunities**: Can validate with users after each phase
5. **Flexibility**: Can adjust scope of later phases based on early feedback

## Cross-Phase Considerations

- **Design System**: Monochrome design tokens implemented in Phase 1, applied throughout
- **Security**: RLS policies established in Phase 1, extended in each phase
- **Performance**: Caching and optimization considered from Phase 1
- **Mobile**: Capacitor setup in Phase 1, mobile-specific features throughout

## Success Criteria by Phase

- **Phase 1**: Authentication working, Strava data flowing, basic UI functional
- **Phase 2**: Metrics computed correctly, charts displaying trends, PBs detected
- **Phase 3**: Coach can plan and review, athletes receive notifications, comments working
- **Phase 4**: AI summaries generating, admin tools functional, ready for production

Each phase includes specific acceptance criteria and testing requirements detailed in the individual phase files.
